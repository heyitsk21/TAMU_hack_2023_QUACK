        <h2 class="scienceh2"'>Moon Phases</h2>
        <p class="scip">
            Hey there, curious minds! There are many different categories of science. Let' s start with one of the
          coolest things in the night sky ‚Äì the Moon and its different phases. </p>
          <p class='scip'>
            The Moon doesn't shine on its own; it reflects the light of the Sun. As the Moon orbits Earth, different
            portions of it are illuminated by the Sun, creating what we call "moon phases."
          </p>
          <p class='scip'>
            There are eight main phases of the Moon: New Moon, Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Full
            Moon, Waning Gibbous, Last Quarter, and Waning Crescent. Each phase has a unique appearance, and it takes
            about 29.5 days for the Moon to complete its entire cycle.
          </p>
          <p class='scip'>
            During a New Moon, the side facing Earth is not visible because it is not illuminated. As the days go by, we
            see more and more of the illuminated part, leading up to the Full Moon, where the entire side facing Earth
            is lit up.
          </p>
          <p class='scip'>
            So, the next time you look up at the night sky and see the Moon, observe its shape and see if you can
            identify which phase it's in. It's like the Moon is playing a cosmic game of hide-and-seek with the Sun!

      <h2 class="scienceh2"'>Biology and Anatomy</h2>
  <p class=' scip'>
        Have you ever wondered about your body? Me too! The body is made of many complex systems and has several parts.
        </p>
        <p class='scip'>
          Did you know the body has 206 bones? All of that just in one body!
        </p>
        <p class='scip'>
          If you thought Moon Phases were interesting, you'll love Biology and Anatomy. In simple terms, biology is the
          study of life, and anatomy is the study of the body and its systems. Both are very important to understand.
