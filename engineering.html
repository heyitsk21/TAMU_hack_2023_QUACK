      <h2 class="engh">What is Engineering?</h2>
      <p class="engp">
        Engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to develop solutions to real-world
        problems. It involves designing, building, and creating things that we use every day, such as roads, bridges,
        buildings, and technology.
      </p>
      <p class="engp">
        From the shoes we wear to the cars we ride in, engineering is all around us. It's what makes our world better,
        safer, and more efficient. Engineers use their creativity and problem-solving skills to invent and innovate,
        making our lives easier and more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p class="engp">
        Not only does engineering help us in our daily lives, but it also plays a crucial role in the advancement of
        society. It drives technological progress and improves the quality of life for people around the world.
      </p>
      <p class="engp">
        Through engineering, we can develop solutions for sustainable living, clean energy, and efficient
        transportation.
        It's about finding ways to make the world a better place for everyone.
      </p>
      <p class="engp">
        So, whether it's through designing eco-friendly cars or creating innovative medical devices, engineering is at
        the
        heart of making the world a better place for all of us.
