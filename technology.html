        Technology has become a vital part of our lives, and allows us to be connected throughout the world. Usually,
        you don't realize how much technology you use in your daily life, but technology is the reason you can access
        this website. While there is still plenty of room for improvement, technology has advanced a lot in the past few
        decades and is irreplaceable in society.
